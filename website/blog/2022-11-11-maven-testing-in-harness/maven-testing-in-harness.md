### Introduction

In this tutorial, we will go through a step-by-step example, on how to use the Harness CI for Maven testing. 

#### Pre-Requisite:
[Docker Connector](https://docs.harness.io/article/u9bsd77g5a-docker-registry-connector-settings-reference#docker-connector-settings-reference) to fetch public Docker images of [maven chrome jdk8](https://hub.docker.com/r/rvancea/maven-chrome-jdk8)

Let’s now deepdive into the step-by-step tutorial, wherein we will now use the Harness SaaS platform to set-up the maven testing:

#### Step-1:
Start with the **build module**, and give it a name test, make sure to keep the clone codebase slider “off” as it is not required in this example.

#### Step-2:
Now let’s move to the next part of the pipeline, which is to select the infrastructure and select **Harness Hosted Builds** under the same.

#### Step-3:
Moving on to the execution step, let’s add a **Run Step** and name it as “testrun” and under the container registry add the already created Docker Connector, and under the image add the “rvancea/maven-chrome-jdk8”. Now let’s add a shell command to run `mvn clean compile -DsuiteXmlFile=Batch1 test`  and apply the changes.

#### Step-4:
Now, let’s add another **Run Step** similar to the above and name it as reports, just here contrary to the above step the command changes to `find . -name "*.xml"`.

![filesgen](./filesgen.png)

#### Step-5:
It’s time to add the failure strategy now as a **Run Step**, with the following command.
```shell
actualFailedTestsStatus=<+execution.steps.testrun.status>
echo $actualFailedTestsStatus
if [ "$actualFailedTestsStatus" = "IGNORE_FAILED" ]
then
 echo "tests have failed"
 exit 1
else
 echo "Failure reruns have passed"
 exit 0
fi
```

#### Step-6:
Now, since the pipeline is complete, let’s save and run the same and the results looks like the following on the console logs.

![reports](./reports.png)

Once the run is successful, the above list of files are generated and can be further stored and processed as the test reports. 

For, further reference following is the pipeline yaml of the above mentioned example

```yaml
